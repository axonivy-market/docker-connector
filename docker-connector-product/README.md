# Docker Connector

Containers are lightweight, isolated units that package applications with their dependencies, ensuring consistency and portability across different environments. Docker is a widely-used platform with a daemon-based architecture that provides extensive container management features and ecosystem tools like Docker Hub and Docker Compose. Podman, an alternative to Docker, also manages containers but operates without a central daemon, focusing on security and simplicity. Both tools can handle Docker container images and share similar command-line functionalities, making transitions between them easier. While Docker relies on a background service, Podmanâ€™s daemonless design allows for direct management of containers.

**With our docker connector you can create, start, stop and remove docker containers in Docker Desktop or in Podman directly from an Axon Ivy business process.**
 
 ## Demo

The prerequisite for the demo process is that a Docker daemon is running on your computer. This can be achieved using tools like Docker Desktop or Podman. In the following example, we used Podman.

In the first step  we show you how to create a container for the Axon Ivy engine by using the Axon Ivy engine image you find at docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/axonivy/axonivy-engine.

Next, the container is started - and with it an application on localhost with which an Axon Ivy Engine is started:

The container created in Podman:

![image](images/dockerdemo3.png)

An UI is now opened in the process, which gives you the option of stopping and deleting this container again by clicking "Proceed".

The container is now removed from Podman:

## Setup

To setup the Docker Connnector, add the following variable to your Axon Ivy Project:
```
@variables.yaml@
```
